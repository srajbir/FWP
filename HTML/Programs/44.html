    <h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>

    <p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: borders, padding,
        margins, and the actual content.</p>

    <div>This text is the content of the box. We have added a 50px padding, 20px margin and a 15px green border. In
        order that for the most part, any one of us will come to the exercise of any kind of employment except to take
        advantage of the objectives from it. But the pain in the film is irure to condemn, in the pleasure it wants to
        escape from the pain of being clum in pain, none result. They are the exceptions the blinds yearn for, they
        don't see, they are the ones who abandon their responsibilities to the fault that is soothing the soul's
        hardships.</div>
